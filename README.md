Project: Google Homepage Clone <br>
Project Author: Anastasia Gaskamp <br>
Description: <br>
This project is created demonstrating knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is made with Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha-6. Bootstrap was added into this to make this page more responsive, and to make the development easier. For this clone, I actually have made some changes to customize the Google Homepage, as it can be taken as a blank drawing board with room for creativity. It may not be a true 'clone' of the homepage, but it fits my purposes/needs.
<br>
IMPORTANT NOTE:
Bootstrap was added through me learning it myself. I learned it to make pages responsive, and am incorporating it to make this project how I would like to create it. Bootstrap has not yet been covered at this point in the TOP curriculum, it was added at my own choice.

Reflection: <br>
I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. There's still some things I'd like to add (the favicon, for instance), and I'd like to figure out more with the header. I need to learn more about Bootstrap navbars and dropdowns, as they would become very useful in the homepage. I'd also like to know why the link to A Google a Day isn't working, as it's supposed to link to the actual site. The footer needs working links, too. I like how the positioning turned out, too. Overall, I find that there was lots of room for improvement, but it's still good.<br>

Here's the actual end result:
