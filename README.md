Project: Google Homepage Clone
Project Author: Anastasia Gaskamp
Description:
This project is created demonstrating knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is made with Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha-6. Bootstrap was added into this to make this page more responsive, and to make the development easier. For this clone, I actually have made some changes to customize the Google Homepage, as it can be taken as a blank drawing board with room for creativity. It may not be a true 'clone' of the homepage, but it fits my purposes/needs.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Bootstrap was added through me learning it myself. I learned it to make pages responsive, and am incorporating it to make this project how I would like to create it. Bootstrap has not yet been covered at this point in the TOP curriculum, it was added at my own choice.
